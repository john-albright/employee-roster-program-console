# Employee Roster Program - Console

This employee roster console program was created to fulfill the final project requirement for Oakton's CIS 227 C# Programming, a class I took in the spring of 2021 while working towards a [General Programmer Certificate](https://catalog.oakton.edu/career-programs-pathways/computer-information-systems/general-programmer-certificate/). A description of the course can be found in [the Computer Information Systems course descriptions list](https://catalog.oakton.edu/course-descriptions/course-descriptions-discipline/cis/). In addition, the course syllabus and final project assignment pdf for CIS 227 can be found in the course_info folder of the repository. 

The command line program can be run at [this Replit link](https://replit.com/@john-albright/employee-roster-program-console).

The original Microsoft Visual Studio is in the ms_visual_studio folder of the repository. The folder should be able to be imported into MS Visual Studio and run directly from a local computer. 

An accompanying respository that integrates the same features but in a console format that can be more easily run was also created: [Employee Roster Program - Form](https://github.com/john-albright/employee-roster-program-form).
